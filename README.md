## animals-letty

A more compact yet still complex robot to build as a way to test the company's AI capabilities. And to stay alive after the fall.

## Prototypical form of a mechanical fawn

## Key-Task

Build completely from scratch all the parts using the eight-to-ten motors that I have on-hand:

* Five [MX-28AT](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-28/)
* Three [AX-12A](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/ax/ax-12a/)

Note that with a spring-retracting ankle, two motors per leg; one for next rotate and pivot (like with the cyberdeck head). Ordered three horns.
